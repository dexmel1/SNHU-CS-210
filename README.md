Intro to C++ Programming

### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
- The project was designed to allow the user to study trends for grocery items and frequencies. The user could search for specific items and find out the frequency the item was purchased or see overall lists of items and frequency.

### What did you do particularly well?
- Converting the user's input to lowercase as well as converting any item name added to the map significantly increased the accuracy of validating whether or not an item was present in the map.

### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
- Improve the function for converting strings to lowercase. There may be a way to streamline this more. This would improve the speed of the overall program.

### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
- Reading and writing from files was the hardest portion for me. Utilizing the coursework as well as online research assisted in successfully completing the project.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?
- Working with files as well as being more memory-conscious. Other languages let programmers become complacent with opening and closing variables.

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- Simple functions with proper naming conventions as well as inline comments explaining the process and intentions.
